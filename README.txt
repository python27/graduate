This program is used for download images from website
http://grs.zju.edu.cn
you can use the program to download images form other websites,
of course youneed to modify the code slightly.

The Origin of the program

-----------------
Recently, Zhejiang University published the graduate photos in the website:
http://grs.zju.edu.cn/2013xw/, 
you can download the photos only before 2013/04/20
-----------------

So I decide to write a small program to download all the photos for the 
graduates who may miss the deadline.

Note:the downloaded images are stored in the folder <full>, but I use
gitignore to ignore the <full> folder, so you cannot see it.
