# Graduate

## About the project
This is a small crawling program for downloading images from websites,
it uses the open source web crawling framework [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/ "Scrapy")

Particularly, this program is used for download images from website
[ZJU](http://grs.zju.edu.cn/ "ZJU graduate")
you can use the program to download images form other websites,
of course you need to modify the code slightly.

## Origin of the project

> Recently, Zhejiang University published the graduate photos [online](http://grs.zju.edu.cn/2013xw/),
> you can download the photos only before 2013/04/20

So I decide to write a small program to download all the photos for the 
graduates who may miss the deadline.

## Note
The downloaded images are stored in the folder `full`, but I use
gitignore to ignore the `full` folder, so you cannot see it.
